    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original task: “Calculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.”\n",
    "Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",
    "Result: \"There are 28 apples.\"\n",
    "Reasoning: \"I am done.\""
